# This file is a *template* for your local environment variables.
# It shows what keys the backend expects (and example formats).
# 
# DO NOT put real API keys or secrets here.
# DO NOT rename or use this file directly for local runs.
# 
# Instead:
#   1. Copy this file to a new one called `.env` in the same folder:
#        cp .env.example .env
#   2. Fill in your own real values inside `.env`
#   3. Keep `.env` private — it’s already listed in `.gitignore`
#      so Git will *never* push it to GitHub.
# 
# Render (or other cloud hosts) will manage their own environment
# variables securely through the web dashboard.
# 
# Example:
#   APP_ENV=prod
#   CORS_ORIGINS=https://cloudvibecoder.com
#   OPENAI_API_KEY=sk-your-real-key-here
APP_ENV=dev
CORS_ORIGINS=http://localhost:8081
OPENAI_API_KEY=key-goes-here
